## Data Migration Strategy

### Critical Data to Preserve
1. **User Accounts & Profiles** (100% migration required)
2. **Historical Tasks** (complete history for analytics)
3. **Work Updates with Images** (quality tracking data)
4. **Client Information** (business continuity)
5. **Performance Metrics** (AI training data)

### Migration Scripts Required
```python
# Example migration structure
scripts/
├── export_supabase_data.py      # Export from current system
├── transform_data.py            # Clean and transform data
├── import_to_postgresql.py      # Load into new system
├── validate_migration.py        # Verify data integrity
└── rollback_procedures.py       # Emergency rollback
```

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Loss** during migration → Multiple backups + validation
2. **AI Model Accuracy** → Start with high-confidence thresholds
3. **Mobile Performance** → Optimize for low-end devices
4. **User Adoption** → Gradual rollout with training

### Contingency Plans
1. **Parallel Running** - Run old system alongside new for 2 weeks
2. **Feature Flags** - Enable new features gradually
3. **Rollback Strategy** - Ability to revert to Supabase system
4. **Progressive Web App** - Fallback if mobile app issues

## Success Metrics
